# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Hand Gesture Recognition is a significant area of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technology. This project demonstrates the development of a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the MediaPipe framework, TensorFlow, and OpenCV in Python.

## Introduction

Gesture recognition plays a pivotal role in enabling intuitive control systems, and one of its most exciting applications is drone navigation. This project harnesses the power of hand gestures to control drones, offering a touch-free, natural interaction method ideal for various scenarios such as surveillance, search and rescue, and aerial photography.

It utilizes MediaPipe, Google's open-source framework, for accurate real-time hand tracking and keypoint detection. TensorFlow powers the gesture classification model, enabling the system to recognize a wide range of predefined gestures. OpenCV is used for real-time image capture and processing through a webcam, forming the core of the interactive control interface. This integration enables users to command drones through simple hand gestures, making drone operation more accessible and responsive than ever.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV 4.5
3. MediaPipe 0.8.11
4. TensorFlow 2.5.0
5. NumPy 1.19.3

## Accessing the Application

Ensure your webcam is connected and functional.

Open a web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Upon accessing the provided URL, the web application interface for hand gesture detection will be displayed. You can perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to observe real-time recognition.
